Welcome to a Number Guessing game!

How To Play:

1. A random number between 1 and 20 is hidden behind a question mark.
2. Your task is to guess that number by writing your guess in the "Guess.." input field.
3. If your guess is greater than a randomly chosen number, "Too High...ğŸ“ˆ" message is displayed.
4. If your guess is less than a randomly chosen number, "Too Low...ğŸ“ˆ" message is displayed.
5. You have a total of 5 attempts to guess the number.
6. Each wrong guess decreases your score(the number of attempts).
7. After a correct guess a high score of your attempts is displayed.

Have Fun!
